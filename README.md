Waive petty restrictions out of your code

## Why?

Direct quote from [unlicense.org]():

> Because you have more important things to do than enriching lawyers or
> imposing petty restrictions on users of your code. How often have you passed
> up on utilizing and contributing to a great software library just because
> its open source license was not compatible with your own preferred flavor of
> open source? How many precious hours of your life have you spent
> deliberating how to license your software or worrying about licensing
> compatibility with other software? You will never get those hours back, but
> here's your chance to start cutting your losses. Life's too short, let's get
> back to coding.
